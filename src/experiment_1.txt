The results of our experiment suggest that, as the tree size increases, the chance of winning goes down, though not by an incredibly significant amount. There is a possibility that this could be due to random chance. Given more time, I would be interested to see if these results remain true at much larger tree sizes, with much greater differences in the number of trees.
