CMPM 146 Project. Collaborated with Yash Solanki.

Ultimate TicTacToe bots powered by a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm. For our modified bot, the rollout policy was modified to see if there was a move that would result in a box being captured available in the list of next moves - if there was, that move would be taken. If not, a random move would be selected instead.
